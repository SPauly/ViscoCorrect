**ViscoCorrect** is a tool that calculates correction factors for centrifugal pumps for the viscosity, head and flowrate of a pumped liquid based on its viscosity.
The tool uses a graphical approach based on [this graph](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-graph-obtained-by-the-American-Institute-of-hydraulics_fig1_335209726) obtained by the American Institute of Hydraulics.
