# ViscoCorrect
ViscoCorrect is a tool that calculates correction factors for centrifugal pumps for the viscosity, head and flowrate of a pumped liquid based on its viscosity.   

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a student and have created a small software tool that helps calculate the correction factors for centrifugal pumps for the viscosity based on one of your standards. Since I could not use your actual values, the program works by merely converting the input values to pixel values.  
I am interested in open-sourcing and further developing this project, but I have concerns about the legal implications. Furthermore, I would be delighted to collaborate with you on this project, should you be interested. 

I, therefore, would be very happy if you could direct my inquiry to a person in charge of these matters.  
Of course, I am pleased to offer any additional details you may need regarding the project. 
Yours sincerely,
Simon Pauly
