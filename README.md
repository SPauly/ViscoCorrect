# ViscoCorrect [![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FSPauly%2FViscoCorrect.svg?type=shield&issueType=license)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FSPauly%2FViscoCorrect?ref=badge_shield) 
**ViscoCorrect** is a tool that calculates correction factors for centrifugal pumps for the viscosity, head and flowrate of a pumped liquid based on its viscosity.
The tool uses a graphical approach based on [this graph](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-graph-obtained-by-the-American-Institute-of-hydraulics_fig1_335209726) obtained by the American Institute of Hydraulics.


**Disclaimer:** This software is purely experimental and all calculated values should be verified manually. Use at your own risk. Note that the used standard is **deprecated!** The HI advises only using the latest [ANSI/HI 9.6.7 Standard](https://www.pumps.org/what-we-do/standards/?pumps-search-product=9.6.7).

## What's been implemented so far
ViscoCorrect is still in its early stages of development but the major features are already implemented! Note however that they still require some testing.
